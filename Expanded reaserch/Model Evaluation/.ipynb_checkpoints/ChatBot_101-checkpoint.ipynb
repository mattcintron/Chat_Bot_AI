    "## Types of Chat Bot's\n",
    "In the world of machine learning and AI there are many different kinds of chat bots. Some chat bots are virtual assistants, others are just there to talk to, some are customer support agents and you've probably seen some of the ones used by businesses to answer questions. For this tutorial we will be creating a relatively simple chat bot that will be be used to answer frequently asked questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Packages\n",
    "Before starting to work on our chatbot we need to download a few python packages. Please note as of writing this these packages will ONLY WORK IN PYTHON 3.6. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simply use pip to install the following:\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- nltk\n",
    "- tensorflow\n",
    "- tflearn\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply go to CMD and type: pip install \"package name\". Where you will replace \"package_name\" with all of the entries listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data\n",
    "Now it's time to understand what kind of data we will need to provide our chatbot with. Since this is a simple chatbot we don't need to download any massive datasets. We will just use data that we write ourselves. To follow along with the tutorial properly you will need to create a .JSON file that contains the same format as the one seen below. I've called my file \"intents.json\"."

For example, the word \"thats\" stem might be \"that\" and the word \"happening\" would have the stem of \"happen\". We will use this process of stemming words to reduce the vocabulary of our model and attempt to find the more general meaning behind sentences.\n",

    "## Bag of Words\n",
    "Now that we have loaded in our data and created a stemmed vocabulary it's time to talk about a bag of words. As we know neural networks and machine learning algorithms require numerical input. So out list of strings wont cut it. We need some way to represent our sentences with numbers and this is where a bag of words comes in. What we are going to do is represent each sentence with a list the length of the amount of words in our models vocabulary. Each position in the list will represent a word from our vocabulary. If the position in the list is a 1 then that will mean that the word exists in our sentence, if it is a 0 then the word is nor present. We call this a bag of words because the order in which the words appear in the sentence is lost, we only know the presence of words in our models vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as formatting our input we need to format our output to make sense to the neural network. Similarly to a bag of words we will create output lists which are the length of the amount of labels/tags we have in our dataset. Each position in the list will represent one distinct label/tag, a 1 in any of those positions will show which label/tag is represented."
